<h2>Products</h2>

<!-- 
With *ngFor, the <div> repeats for each product in the list.

Structural directives shape or reshape the DOM's structure, by adding, removing, and manipulating elements.  -->
<div *ngFor="let product of products">
  <h3>
    <a
      [title]="product.name + ' details'"
      [routerLink]="['/products', product.id]"
    >
      {{ product.name }}
    </a>
  </h3>

  <!-- *ngIf directive so that Angular only creates the <p> element if the current product has a description. -->
  <p *ngIf="product.description">Description: {{ product.description }}</p>

  <button type="button" (click)="share()">Share</button>

  <!-- Finally, to display ProductAlertsComponent as a child of ProductListComponent, add the <app-product-alerts> element to product-list.component.html. Pass the current product as input to the component using property binding.
  
  Name is from ProductAlertsComponent Selector -->
  <app-product-alerts [product]="product" (notify)="onNotify()">
